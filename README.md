This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `useRef` hook in React Native: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'current')". The `useRefBug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `useRefSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.  The issue arises from attempting to access the ref's `current` property before it has been initialized, typically during component mounting. The solution involves using a conditional check to ensure the ref is ready before accessing `current`.
