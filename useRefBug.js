This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a functional component. The error message may vary, but it usually indicates that you are trying to access the `current` property of the ref before it has been initialized. This commonly happens when you attempt to access or manipulate the DOM element or other values referenced before the component has fully mounted.
